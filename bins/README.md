## Here are some pre-existing TI-83+/TI-84+ files
I do **NOT** claim copyright over these files. They are here for example and for unittests.
Most of these are collected from around the internet. The flash apps mostly come from [here](https://archive.org/details/ti8x-apps). SOme of these files I made, some other people online made.
